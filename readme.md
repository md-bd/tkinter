# TKINTER APPLICATION MAKING

This repository was created to keep the source codes of one free course I followed to learn the basics of tkinter. 


tkinter-course folder has all the source codes I wrote following the course. 


I did not use tkinter for any purpose for a few years. Later, I had to use it for some project and learned some new tricks. So, wanted to make an app that is more featureful and uses some of those features. I have made an app using tkinter to crop an image. The folder tkinter-image-crop-app contains the source code, readme with instruction and a dockerfile.
